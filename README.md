- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Warren
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming video games and making games graphisms.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me 'antoine.f1987@ant01.fr' or my youtube channel : 'https://www.youtube.com/@thegamesofthewarren4789' to see some screencasts of my games. My itch.io account : 'https://warrengames.itch.io/' if you are looking for games assets/textures, you might be interested.

- Breakout4 game has been updated to version 0.1.6 ! The main change is the menu to play a specific level of the one player game (both campaigns). The demo recording mode now supports the spawning of fire balls and burning skulls (for 'hell' theme levels).

- A new game was added. This is a memory game programmed with the C++ language (see meomry-cpp repository for more details). The difference with the C language version is that there is 2 themes of cards, the traditionnal 70s game vignettes and new vignettes made with the POVRay raytracer.
- February 2nd 2025 update for Breakout4: some changes like a Wiki/Help section in the game, for a better understanding of the mechanisms of the game.

- I changed the new default branches to 'devWithAllLibs' for the following repositories: 'Bob the blob', 'Breakout4' and 'SDL2-WarrenTetris'. These branches are more convenient when you want to compile the source because you don't need my 'warrenCustomLibs' repository since all needed libraries are included already in the devWithAllLibs branches.

- Discover the new 'Bob the blob' game branch named 'devWithAllLibs' that is more convenient to compile (you don't need the 'WarrenCustomLibs' repository as a dependency). The libraries inside WarrenCustomLibs that were needed to Bob the Blob has been included inside the branch 'devWithAllLibs' of Bob the Blob.
- Discover the new 'Breakout4' game branch named 'devWithAllLibs' that is more convenient to compile (you don't need the 'WarrenCustomLibs' repository as a dependency). The libraries inside WarrenCustomLibs that were needed to Breakout4 has been included inside the branch 'devWithAllLibs' of Breakout4.
- Discover the new 'SDL2-WarrenTetris' game branch named 'devWithAllLibs' that is more convenient to compile (you don't need the 'WarrenCustomLibs' repository as a dependency). The libraries inside WarrenCustomLibs that were needed to SDL2-WarrenTetris has been included inside the branch 'devWithAllLibs' of this same repository.
