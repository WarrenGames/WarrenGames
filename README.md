- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Warren
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming video games.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me 'antoine.f1987@ant01.fr'
- Check out my web site for more informations about my games and other free graphisms without drm for your games : 'https://www.ant01.fr'

- Check out the new 'Bob the blob' game branch named 'devWithAllLibs' that is more convenient to compile (you don't need the 'WarrenCustomLibs' repository as a dependency). The libraries inside WarrenCustomLibs that were needed to Bob the Blob has been included inside the branch 'devWithAllLibs' of Bob the Blob.
