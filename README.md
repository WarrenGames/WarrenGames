- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Warren
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming video games.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me 'antoine.f1987@ant01.fr' or my youtube channel : 'https://www.youtube.com/@thegamesofthewarren4789' to see some screencasts of my games.

-The breakout4 code has been update the October 15th 2024.

-The breakout4 has been updated (code and 1440x1080 releases) the september 29th 2024. Some levels that caused segfault have been fixed.

- A bug in sdl2_wrapper library has been fixed (in the files 'boxEvent.h' and 'boxEvent.cpp'). See changes.txt at the root dir for more details.

- Breakout4 repository has been updated (a bug that came when running cmake has been fixed).

- Discover my web site for more informations about my games and other free graphisms without drm for your games : 'https://www.ant01.fr'

- There are new releases of the Bob the blob binaries and the source code since july 28 2024 (version 0.1.11). A joystick support has been added.

- I changed the new default branches to 'devWithAllLibs' for the following repositories: 'Bob the blob', 'Breakout4' and 'SDL2-WarrenTetris'. These branches are more convenient when you want to compile the source because you don't need my 'warrenCustomLibs' repository since all needed libraries are included already in the devWithAllLibs branches.

- Discover the new 'Bob the blob' game branch named 'devWithAllLibs' that is more convenient to compile (you don't need the 'WarrenCustomLibs' repository as a dependency). The libraries inside WarrenCustomLibs that were needed to Bob the Blob has been included inside the branch 'devWithAllLibs' of Bob the Blob.
- Discover the new 'Breakout4' game branch named 'devWithAllLibs' that is more convenient to compile (you don't need the 'WarrenCustomLibs' repository as a dependency). The libraries inside WarrenCustomLibs that were needed to Breakout4 has been included inside the branch 'devWithAllLibs' of Breakout4.
- Discover the new 'SDL2-WarrenTetris' game branch named 'devWithAllLibs' that is more convenient to compile (you don't need the 'WarrenCustomLibs' repository as a dependency). The libraries inside WarrenCustomLibs that were needed to SDL2-WarrenTetris has been included inside the branch 'devWithAllLibs' of this same repository.
